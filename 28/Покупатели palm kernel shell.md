Palm kernel shell (PKS) is a by product in the production of palm oil and is commonly used in the natural biomass energy industry.PKS is a fibrous material,brownish yellow in colour and with particle sizes normally ranging between 5 mm and 40 mm.Due to its high calorific value,averaging 4000 Kcal kg,and low ash content,it is considered an attractive source of fuel in the production of.Palm and Palm Kernel Oil Production and Processing in.Palm Kernel Crushing Process.The typical palm kernel oil extraction uses mechanical extraction.The mechanical extraction method is widely practiced since the technology is much cheaper in capital investment and operating costs,even though it has limitations in oil recovery and produces poorer quality of palm kernel cake.
