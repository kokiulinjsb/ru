## Gold CIL & CIP Gold Leaching Process Explained CCD
CIL stands for carbon in leach.This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to the leach tanks (or reaction vessel) so that leaching and adsorption take place in the same tanks.CIL is slightly different from another gold extraction process called CIP or carbon in pulp process.The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An Introduction.Oct 20,2014 · These are "refractory ores" and require a chemical,not simply physical,process to liberate gold from the surrounding rock.The Albion Process ™,developed at Core's laboratories in the 1990's,is one such process and is now in use globally (see a recent report on a gold Albion Process plant here).Other processes for treating.
