## Coal Separation With The Air Dense Medium Fluidized Bed.
In recent years,many research studies have been conducted on dry coal separation technology such as the compound dry cleaning separator (FGX dry separator),air jig,reflux classifier,and air dense medium fluidized bed (ADMFB) [17 19].Cleaning of South African coal using a compound dry.The compound dry separator shown in Fig.1 is provided by the Shenzhou Machinery Co.It consists of coal feed,separation,air supply,dust collection,and electrical control modules.The coal feed section is comprised of skirt board seals and a vibrational feeder.

## How Dry Coal Processing Work Coal Processing Methods
In a typical FGX dry cleaning system,the feed is introduced into a surge bin from which the underflow is controlled using an electromagnetic vibratory feeder.Three product streams,i.e.clean (deshaled) product,middlings and tailing streams are generated during the separation process.Dry Cleaning of Pulverized Coal Using a Novel Rotary.A cleaner coal product can be obtained if a dry process is avaialble to further clean pulverized and thus better liberated fine coal at the power plant prior to its combustion.In this study,a novel rotary triboelectrostatic separator (RTS) was investigated for its application to dry cleaning of fine coal samples acquired from the power plants.
