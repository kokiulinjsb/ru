## History Abergynolwyn
Bryneglwys Quarry was first worked for slate in the 1840s by local entrepreneur John Pughe of Aberdyfi,but transportation difficulties led to it falling idle around 1859.In 1864 the Aberdovey Slate Company (from 1867 the Abergynolwyn Slate Company) reopened the workings with capital raised in Manchester.HistoryAbergynolwyn was the original passenger terminus.A mineral line extended south west to the incline up to the slate quarry at Bryn Eglwys.The railway's first locomotive shed was at Ty Dwr,0.25 miles (0.40 km) west of the station.This location was chosen as it had a plentiful water supply from the local stream,and was close to the quarry.
