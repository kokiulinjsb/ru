## Molybdenum Statistics and Information USGS
Molybdenum (Mo) is a refractory metallic element used principally as an alloying agent in steel,cast iron,and superalloys to enhance hardenability,strength,toughness,and wear and corrosion resistance.To achieve desired metallurgical properties,molybdenum,primarily in the form of molybdic oxide or ferromolybdenum,is frequently used in combination with or added toPlentiful supplies to hamper molybdenum's price rally.Nov 27,2019 · Bargain hunters have helped molybdenum recover after prices crashed to two year lows,but ample supplies of the metal used to make stainless steel mean further significant gains for now are.

## How Is Molybdenum Used? A Freeport McMoRan Company
Foundries generally use ferromolybdenum when adding molybdenum to cast irons and steels,and steel mills may prefer it to Technical Oxide for some types of steels.The molybdenite concentrate can also be subjected to further processing to produce an upgraded product that can be used as a solid lubricant.High Speed Steel,Molybdenum Steel,Tungesten Steel,Hss.Standard grade for High Speed Steels; owing to its balanced composition has good toughness and cutting performance,hence many applications.HSS Containing cobalt content is a high performance steel with good cutting capability & ensures high red hardness and tempering retention.
