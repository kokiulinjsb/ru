## Evaluation of quaternary phosphonium salt as the collector.
Organic phosphorous compounds recently have received more attention because of the stronger affinity towards metals and metal oxides.In the present study,tributyltetradecylphosphonium chloride (TTPC),a quaternary phosphonium salt (cationic type),was introduced and evaluated in the system of bauxite reverse flotation.Concentration of bauxite fines via froth flotationThe tailings still contain bauxite,which can be separated by reverse froth flotation (flotation of the quartz and depression of the bauxite),using starch as a depressant and amine as a promoter; the pH must be around 10.0.
