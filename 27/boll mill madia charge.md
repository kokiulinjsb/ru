## AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills & Circuits Mining Mill.
For overflow ball mills,the charge should not exceed 45% of the mill volume.For grate discharge mills,the charge should occupy about 50% of the mill volume.Bond developed a relationship that can be used to determine the percent charge by volume as a function of the vertical height above the charge,He,and the radius of the mill,R,i.e.Theory and Practice for usstonewareresult in mills operating at optimum speed if low media charge or low consistency is used in the mill.The use of lifter bars welded or bolted to the mill cylinder in unlined mills reduces media slippage in mills whose rotational velocity is slow.Lifter bars are recommended when the grinding media charge is below 45 percent of the mill volume.
