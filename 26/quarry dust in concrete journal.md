## Partial Replacement of Sand with Quarry Dust in Concrete
The reduction in the sources of natural sand and the requirement for reduction in the cost of concrete production has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregates in the production of concretes especially in Concrete.Quarry dust,a by product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials.Strength,Water Absorption and Carbonation Depth of Micro.Jun 19,2016 · The introduction of quarry dust (QD) seems acceptable since the study on the chemical composition shows that the QD can be classified under category mineral admixture Class N (pozzolan).This paper deals with the utilization of MFQD as a partial replacement of cement in the concrete.
