The Bushveld Complex crops out in east and west arching limbs with a total strike length of over 350km (Fig.1).The two limbs dip gently inward towards each other and appear to be connected at depth (Cawthorn & Webb,2001;Webbet al.2004),implying that the main part of the Bushveld is a shallow,bowl shaped body (Kruger,2005).Bushveld Igneous Complex WikipediaThe Bushveld Igneous Complex (BIC) is the largest layered igneous intrusion within the Earth's crust.It has been tilted and eroded forming the outcrops around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin: the Transvaal Basin.It is approximately 2 billion years old and is divided into four different limbs: the northern,southern,eastern,and western limbs.
