## DRY BENEFICIATION OF COAL—A REVIEW: Mineral Processing.
Coal continues to play a major role in the economic development of a country,especially in metallurgical industries and conventional power generation plants.For effective utilization of high ash coals,it is necessary to beneficiate them.The wet beneficiation process for coal cleaning is currently the predominant method of purification of coal in the world.Mobile Ore Processing and Beneficiation Plant HOT miningOne of the most serious problems confronting the mining industry today is how to profitably begin the small scale milling of ores from mines where insufficient ore has been developed to warrant an expensive mill installation,but where a large plant might be needed later.

## Beneficial Reuse of Coal Ash from Dominion Energy Coal.
Coal fly ash has historically been the primary CCP generated from electric power generation and therefore represents the majority of legacy ash currently stored at power plant waste ponds and landfills across the four Dominion sites investigated.Coal fly ash has a long and successful history of re use in the US and many other countries inLeeuwpan fine coal dense medium plant J r n acyclone (the first stage beneficiation).The primary cyclone overflow is again Leeuwpan fine coal dense medium plant by M.Lundt* and G.J.de Korte† Synopsis Exxaro installed their first ultra fines treatment plant at Leeuwpan Coal mine.The plant is now fully operational and results already show that the plant has great potential.
