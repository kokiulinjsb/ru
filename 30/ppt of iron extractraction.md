## Processes and Procedures in the Extraction of Iron.
The extraction of iron from its ores is quite a technical process.The iron ore is first roasted in air to produce iron(III) oxide which is mixed with coke and limestone and then further heated to a very high temperature in a blast furnace.These materials are loaded into the blast furnace from the top while a blast of hot air is introduced into it from beneath via small pipes known as tuyeres.ALUMINIUM EXTRACTION OF ALUMINIUM ORES OF ALUMINIUM.Aluminium does not occur in free state,but it is widely distributed in nature in the form of compounds.The chief minerals of aluminum are either silicates or oxides.SILICATES: Kaolin Al 2 O 3.2SiO 2.2H 2 O Potash felspar K 2 O.Al 2 O 3.6SiO 2 Potash mica K.
