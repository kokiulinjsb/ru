## How much carbon dioxide is produced when different fuels.
How much carbon dioxide is produced when different fuels are burned? Different fuels emit different amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in relation to the energy they produce when burned.To analyze emissions across fuels,compare the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of energy output or heat content.Chapter 06 Filtration SUEZQuartz sand,silica sand,anthracite coal,garnet,magnetite,and other materials may be used as filtration media.Silica sand and anthracite are the most commonly used types.When silica is not suitable (e.g.in filters following a hot process softener where the treated water is intended for boiler feed),anthracite is usually used.
