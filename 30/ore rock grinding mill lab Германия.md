## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A VSI mill throws rock or ore particles against a wear plate by slinging them from a spinning center that rotates on a vertical shaft.This type of mill uses the same principle as a VSI crusher.Tower mill.Tower mills,often called vertical mills,stirred mills or regrind mills,are a more efficient means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes,and can be used after ball mills in a.AN INITIAL REVIEW OF THE METALLURGICAL PERFORMANCE.mill is a HIG 75 200,with a 200 liter capacity,an installed power of 75 kW and equipped with unique interchangeable mill internals specially developed for both fine and coarse grinding.The mill was installed and commissioned in August 2014.Figure 6 shows a picture of this installed unit.
