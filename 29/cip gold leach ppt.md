## PICAGOLD GoldSorb Carbon Selection Guide for CIP CIL.
Carbon Selection Guide for CIP CIL Processes The importance of Activated Carbon in any gold extraction process cannot be over emphasized.Activated Carbon plays a critical role towards the profitability (operating costs) of a gold project and the following factors are considered in choosing the right carbon: • Hardness & Abrasion ResistanceFactors influencing the rate of gold cyanide leaching and.,which have been shown in many projects to describe gold leaching and adsorption rates well.These equations are then used in CIP and CIL models to predict profiles of gold in solution,on the carbon and in the leach residue across a series of leaching and adsorption tanks in which carbon is advanced countercurrent to the flow of slurry.
