## Performance of dense medium cyclone in cleaning fine coal.
The Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center of the US DOE recently conducted an in house research study evaluating the use of heavy liquids in a cyclone to beneficiate fine size coal.A closed loop cyclone circuit was designed,constructed,and fitted with a 5 cm cyclone having a nominal 2 tph throughput.What is Network Throughput?Throughput refers to the number of information units a system can process within a specified amount of time.In the context of communication networks like the internet,throughput is the rate at which messages are delivered successfully.What is Network Throughput?
